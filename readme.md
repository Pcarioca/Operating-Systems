To run my code, run the following commands in a linux terminal:

make

./test.sh

The shell script will call the program using different commands and simulate standard output to input, delete, write to file etc.
The log is stored into logged_hunt and the binary output is in treasures.dat. The shell script outputs the standard output also onto exported_treasures.txt
